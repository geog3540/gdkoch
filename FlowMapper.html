	 <p class="card-text">By comparing the interactions between the different variables displayed it is possible to make relatively accurate interpretations of the spatial patterns. The spatial pattern that is most apparent to me when I first look at this map is the relatively high rates emigration in the east/central US, particularly surrounding the state of Missouri. However, a large amount of the families that are moving from these states are moving in between these states as well as to Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado. Because of the high number of migration events in these areas, I believe that the immigration to these states is not high enough to balance out the overall emigration from these areas to states like Oklahoma and Texas which is why their emigration rates are so high despite the amount of families migrating in the area. Along the eastern coast it appears that most people are moving between neighboring states overall, with some families moving more west but not are the rate of families in the Midwest. This is shown with relatively few family migration events, low emigration and few families moving primarily to neighboring states along the coast. Additionally, there appears to be relatively low immigration to areas in the northern Midwest and southwest. There appear it be relatively low migration events to California however overall, not very many people are leaving California once they get there. A similar pattern exists in the Northwest with low rates of immigration and fewer numbers of families migrating. I am curious to why there are so many people moving from Utah to Idaho in this time frame, however. Finally, a large number of families appear to be moving to Oklahoma and Texas with a large amounts of migration events, high numbers of families migrating and high net immigration. Overall, I think the big take away spatially from this map is that during this period the Midwest was a central hub as families moved into this area, and then out again as they moved to the western side of the state. Areas in the east and west coast appear to be more stable with smaller portions of their population moving between states.  </p>
